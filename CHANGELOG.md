# Changelog

Newest changes are always in [README.md](README.md)
- 0.68.0 EXPERIMENTAL support for FIT files - Use just like a GPX file, either supplementing the GoPro or by itself.
  - Not expecting any major issues, with FIT support, but I don't have a huge number of test files.
- 0.67.0 EXPERIMENTAL support for parsing camera orientation. This means it's now possible to show pitch/roll/yaw.
  - But I'm not 100% on the maths, particularly around the rotation axes - so maybe it's not quite right.
  - Use `ori.pich` `ori.roll` `ori.yaw` in widgets/metrics. They have a unit of radians - Feedback welcomed!
- 0.66.0 Fix #78 - Crash when GPS5 packets have zero entries.
  - Add accelerometer entries to csv output 
- 0.65.0 Parse "power" from GPX files. Thanks to [@kfhdk](https://github.com/kfhdk)
  - See [docs/xml/examples/07-metrics](docs/xml/examples/04-metrics) for examples of how to use
  - Also example layout in layouts/power-1920x1080.xml

  - Some (older?) camera's don't have ORIN in ACCL and GYRO streams, so use a default

  - Use metrics `accl.x` `accl.y` and `accl.z` in any widget or metric text
  - New component `bar` - see [bar docs](docs/xml/examples/07-bar)
  - Updated chart can now chart (probably) any metric - see [chart docs](docs/xml/examples/07-chart)
- 0.48.0 Fix [#48](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/issues/48) - h/t [@osresearch](https://github.com/osresearch)  
  - allow 'km' units where appropriate

  - using --layout-xml abc on the command line now implies --layout xml
  - Fix [#31](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/issues/31) h/t [@tve](https://github.com/tve)
  - When alt isn't available, don't blow up trying to calculate gradient
- 0.46.0 New component `compass-arrow` - see layout docs [examples](docs/xml/examples/README.md)
  - progress on support of time-lapse and time-warp files, but they don't work properly yet
  - built-in layout for 2.7k files
- 0.45.0 New Program `gopro-rename.py` - turn idiosyncratically named gopro files GX0100123.MP4 into 20220405-123416-london-england.MP4 using either provided description,
  - or looks up the location from the GPS, and makes file name from that.
  - uses the GPS timestamp to determine the time of the file. 
  - now gopro files will sort properly in your file viewer
  - also works around gopro camera drift, clock is always wrong.
  - can rename whole folders of files 
- 0.44.0 Add [PR#44](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/pull/34) for extracting GPMF to ndjson. Thanks [@gregbaker](https://github.com/gregbaker)
- 0.43.0 Support for [Geoapify](https://geoapify.com/) maps, as well as existing [Thunderforest](https://www.thunderforest.com/) and [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) 
  - Small improvements in API Key handling. See [map styles docs](docs/maps/README.md)
- 0.42.0 Experimental threading mode `--thread` which just sends data to ffmpeg on a background thread. 
  - The result of lots of experimentation on timing, but basically if the GPU is maxed out, that's a limiting factor.
  - This gets a marginal performance gain of about 0.2frames/s for me. Use `nvtop` to check the "ENC" load on the GPU. 
  - Demonstrate that on a `null` ffmpeg, we can generate about 60 overlay frames a second, or 6 seconds/second
- 0.41.0 Allow alpha channel in colours everywhere. This means all text, backgrounds etc can now specify alpha component for colours
  - See docs for text component for [example](docs/xml/examples/01-simple-text/README.md)
- 0.40.0 BIG CHANGE - Hopefully align metadata with video *much* better. Please please raise issues if there are problems.
  - This has been tested with GOPRO Hero 9 and GOPRO Hero 7 - which use two different timing schemes, and appears to work.
  - This changes the way that GPX metadata is aligned with the track, which should also make it better
  - This might change how points with large DOP are rendered... feedback welcomed about how to do this best
- 0.39.0 Fix [#29](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/issues/29)  
- 0.38.0 Fix [#30](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/issues/30) thanks @tve 
- 0.37.0
  - Added new component "Moving Journey Map", which displays the whole journey on a moving map. See [docs](docs/xml/examples/06-moving-journey-map/README.md)
    - Possible fix for [feature request](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/issues/16)
- 0.36.0
  - Fix for `gopro-join.py` when MPEG files are in current directory. - [Issue #24](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/issues/24)
- 0.35.0
  - Add `rotate` to `asi` component. see [docs](docs/xml/examples/07-air-speed-indicator)
  - Some refactoring (should have no visible effect)

    - Add option to disable rotation in moving map (thanks  [@SECtim](https://github.com/SECtim))
- 0.31.0
    - (Change in behaviour) Use input file framerate as output file framerate. This may make output files bigger.
        - A more comprehensive mechanism to control ffmpeg options is planned for a later release
- 0.30.0
    - Attempt to fix character encoding issues on Mac (can't test, as I don't have a Mac)
- 0.29.0
    - Add `compass` component (experimental!) - Draws a simple compass
    - Add `frame` component - Draws a clipping maybe-rounded box to contain other components.
    - Add initial docs for XML layout
- 0.28.0
    - Only rerender moving map if it has moved since last frame - will be much quicker under certain circumstances
    - Refactorings in how map border/opacity is rendered (should have no visible effect, maybe marginally faster)
- 0.27.0
    - Fix [Issue #20](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/issues/20) Minor improvement in GPX parsing.
      Hopefully more tolerant of GPX files that don't contain hr/cadence/temp extensions
- 0.26.0
    - (Change in behaviour) - Fix [Issue #17](https://github.com/time4tea/gopro-dashboard-overlay/issues/17) Will now
      use local timezone when rendering datetimes. (H/T [@tve](https://github.com/tve) )
- 0.25.0
    - (Change in behaviour) - Will now use speed from datasource, in preference to calculated. This should make it much
      more stable, if the datasource supplies it. (GoPro does, GPX not)
- 0.24.0
    - Big internal restructuring of metadata parsing. Will make it easier to import GYRO/ACCL data soon. Incidentally,
      should be a bit faster.
    - Hopefully no externally visible effects.
- 0.23.0
    - Rename --no-overlay to --overlay-only as it was too confusing
- 0.22.0
    - Filter points that have DOP too large.
